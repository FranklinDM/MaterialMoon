# Material Moon
![Preview](https://github.com/FranklinDM/MaterialMoon/blob/master/src/preview.png)

A fork of [PMChrome] (https://github.com/Lootyhoof/pmchrome/), which is a fork of the theme [FXChrome] (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fxchrome/) by dkgo for Pale Moon.

This one contains the material version of the browser and contains a different GUID so that it doesn't replace PMChrome.

## Building
Simply download the contents of the "src" folder  and pack the contents into a .zip file. Then, rename the file to .xpi and drag into the browser.

## Download
Check the releases page of this repository or visit its page on the [Pale Moon Add-ons Site] (https://addons.palemoon.org/themes/material-moon/).
